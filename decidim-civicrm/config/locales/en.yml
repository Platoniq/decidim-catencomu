          - Allows to verify all users belonging to an intelligent group from the
            Catalunya en Comú CRM
          - This verification can only be created from the administration part of
            the platform
          - Users can only be verified with one group at once
          - When a group verification is updated, if its users were verified with
            another group, it will be replaced with the new one
